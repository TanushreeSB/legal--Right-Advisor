# legal- Right Advisor: Automated Evaluation of AI Legal Rights with Zero-Shot Classification and Rule Logic

## **Overview**
**LegalAI Evaluator** is an automated system that assesses artificial intelligence systems against legal frameworks using zero-shot classification and rule-based logic. The platform analyzes AI documentation to determine eligibility for legal rights, protections, and compliance requirements across multiple jurisdictions.

## **✨ Key Features**

- **Zero-Shot Legal Classification**: Evaluates AI systems against legal concepts without pre-labeled training data
- **Multi-Jurisdictional Analysis**: Supports EU AI Act, GDPR, US state regulations, and other global frameworks
- **Explainable AI Decisions**: Provides detailed breakdowns of legal determinations with confidence scores
- **Event-Driven Architecture**: Scalable, serverless processing pipeline for document analysis
